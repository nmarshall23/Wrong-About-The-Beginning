# Changes from Vanilla

## Spawn Point
To give you time to learn the pack, there will be no monsters spawning on the surface at night near spawn. You will also find a fountain that marks where spawn is.

## Wood
Punching trees will not give you a log. Instead you will gain only one plank, sawdust and bark. You can use the sawdust, and bark to a fuel in a furnace.

Use an Axe to harvest logs. However to get planks, split logs in the crafting grid by placing the log with an Axe. You will get 3 planks by splitting logs apposed to only one by punching a tree.

Leaves might drop a Bird's Nest. Right click the nest to get what's inside. Nests will drop the kinds of things you might expect to find, eggs, feathers, shiny things birds find on the ground, things they eat.

## Tools are required

Just like Logs, you need a shovel to collect Dirt and Sand. Otherwise you will get a pile of sand or dirt.

## Food, the Spice of Life

First thing you should kown you will need to farm a diverse number of crops. Food will restore fewer hunger if you repeatly to eat the same item. More complex foods can be made by combining ingredients. You will need to craft cooking tools that are used in the crafting grid to make better foods.

To help manage this there is a kitchen, multi-block, see Cooking for Blockheads.

## Passive Animals

The mod Animania has replaced many of the passive animals with improved versions.
