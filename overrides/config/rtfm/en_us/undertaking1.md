# Point in Space

***You can't have a line without a starting Point***

Your first steps in this pack is gathering the resources you need.

Jump to required [task to move on](#requiredToMoveOn).

## Punch Trees
The first thing you should do is Punch Trees. You need 9 planks to craft a Axe, then go collect more wood. Remember you need to use an Axe to split the logs into planks.

Also grab any Bird's Nests that drop from leaves. Right click them to open them.

## Craft Tools
Make a crafting station, and place a chest next to it for easy access of crafting material. 

If you have gotten any flint form Bird's Nests, make Tinker tools with a tool head of flint, or go mine come cobble for stone. I don't care what tools you use. But you will need a full set of tools.

Fire-starter's are made with bark and some sticks.

## Making Charcoal
The furnace doesn't get hot enought to make charcoal from logs. You will need to make a Charcoal Pit.



## Make a garden

## Go Mining

 
## Coke Oven
The *Immersive Engineering* Coke Oven is used to make Coal Coke and Charcoal. It is a 3 by 3 multiblock, made from 8 Coke Bricks. Read more in your Engineer's Manual under *Overview and Resources*.


## Melter
The *Tinkers' Complement* Melter (block:tcomplement:melter) is a simple furnace that melts raw metals into molten liquids that can be cast into *Tinkers' Construct* tool parts. Place it on top of a Seared Gauge !(block:tconstruct:seared_tank@1). Place a faucet on the side of the Melter and a casting table under the faucet. Next fill the gauge with lava. It works just like a very small smeltery. You will need to make tool part casts from gold, clay or Aluminum Brass.

## Alloy Kiln
The *Immersive Engineering* Alloy Kiln is a simple furnace made out of heat resistant sandstone and bricks. Using it Alloys can be created, for example Aluminum Brass, and Bronze. It is a 2 by 2 multiblock, made from 8 Kiln Bricks. Read more in your Engineer's Manual under *Overview and Resources*.

## <a name="requiredToMoveOn"></a> Millstone
A Millstone will grind up wheat into flour and hemp into .
To move on to the next *Juncture* you will need hemp cloth to make a windmill.


You will need to Build a millstone and grind Hemp. Hemp Fibers are used to craft a 
To make a Windmill requires 192 Hemp Fibers. You get Hemp Fibers by Milling Hemp. You will need 64 Hemp. Place an handcrake next to the millstone. Clicking on it will use a lot of hunger to power the millstone. Hemp grows faster when it's next to other hemp plants.
