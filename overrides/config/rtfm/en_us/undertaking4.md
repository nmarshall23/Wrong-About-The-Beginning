# Way of Steel



This starts with building a Better with Mods Kiln. With a Kiln you can fire blast bricks and make a Bast Furnace and start cooking up steel.",
To make a Kiln requires:

 * Blaze Powder
 * Concentrated Hellfire
 * One Hibachi, more will speed up the Kiln.
 * A Bellows
 * Redstone timing mechanism, a Turn Table is the simplest.
