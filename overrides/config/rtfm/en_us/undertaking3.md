# Rewards of Brimstone
Technically you could go to the nether once you find a Diamond.

This starts with visting the nether. Collecting netherrack and soulsand.

To get to the nether will require you to have a pickaxe that can harvest Obsidian. The simplest way is an Tinkers' Construct pickaxe with an Iron or Bronze head, that has been upgrated with a Diamond. The other option is to collect Creeper Oysters by shearing a creeper. Then use those to make Diamond Ingots, and craft a Diamond Pickaxe.
