# Welcome
The major tech mods of the pack are *Better with Mods*, *Immersive Engineering*, and *Advanced Rocketry*. You will be spending time with each.

## Progression
I expect that you do not know all of these mods. I have arranged them in a logical order, so you can spend time with each and get to know them.
Each *Juncture* in this pack has a problem you need to solve. Then a challenge to move on to the next.

There are a few alternate routes you could take, learning Magic has it's rewards. 

### [Subsistence Farming](undertaking1.md)
Starting out, your biggest need is food. The *Spice of Life* mod makes it so you must eat different meals.

Once you have plenty of food, maybe some animals tamed you are ready to move on. That will require you to build a *Better with Mods* Windmill.

### [Getting Mechanical](undertaking2.md)
You now have a windmill, connect it to the Millstone. You will need leather, and tan it to make a *Better with Mods* Saw.

To move on will require you to find a Diamond. 

### [The Rewards of Brimstone](undertaking3.md)
This is a stop on the road but one you can visit anytime. Visit the Nether collect netherrack, soul sand and blaze powder.
Once you have collected some netherrack, you will need to grind it in a millstone. To move on will require you to build a *Better with Mods* Kiln.

You can now triple ores in a *Better with Mods* Kiln.

### [Way of Steel](undertaking4.md)
Now build a Blast Furnace to smelt steel. You will need a lot of steel.

You can now quadruple ores in a *Immersive Engineering* Crusher.

To move on will require an *Immersive Engineering* Arc Furnace.

### Moving Pass the End
Fuse Eye's of Ender in an Arc Furnace. Find a Stronghold. Go to the end..


### Stars Await
Make a rocket, go to other worlds.
I'm not sure what should be on the other worlds?
Should I add something ridiculous like Draconic Evolution?
