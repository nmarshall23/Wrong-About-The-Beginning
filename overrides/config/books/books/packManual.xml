    <p bold="true" align="center">Spawn Point</p>
    <p>To give you time to learn the pack, there will be no monsters spawning on the surface at night near spawn.</p>
    <p bold="true" align="center">Punching trees</p>
    <p>
    Punching trees will not give you a log. 
    Instead you will gain only one plank, sawdust and bark. You will need to craft an Axe to harvest Logs. Use an Axe in the crafting grid to cut a log into three planks.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
    You can use the sawdust, and bark to cook things.

    <p bold="true" align="center">Food</p>
    <p>Eating the same thing over and over will give you fewer and fewer hunger restored each time.
    Luckly there is a lot more food items added. you will need a large farm to grow all of the crops.
    </p>
    <p>If you are really desperate for food, I'm sure you can dig up something to eat.</p>
    <p bold="true" align="center">Charcoal</p>
    <p>The furnace doesn't get hot enough to make charcoal from logs. Starting out you should make a <link ref="https://forestryforminecraft.info/other:charcoalpit">Charcoal Pit</link>. Let that cook up so you can make plenty of torches.
